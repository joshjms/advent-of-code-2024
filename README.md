# Advent of Code 2024 in Go

Here will be my code solutions and editorial write-ups for Advent of Code 2024 problems.

I am going to challenge myself by forcing myself to write all the solutions in Go. This is inspired by [Russell's](https://github.com/RussellDash332/advent-of-code) initiative to only use one-liner Python solutions - though of course not as hardcore. Maybe next year I'll try bash.
